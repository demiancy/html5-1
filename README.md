This tutorial seemed good to me to remember the concepts of html

2 spaces (no tabs) are used for indentation  
Try not to use lines longer than 80 characters   
\<h1\> should be used only once per page  
In audio tag, the controls attribute is necessary  
The input with type "submit" have value of navigator language
